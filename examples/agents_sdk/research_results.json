      "Summary": "The article addresses challenges and future directions in applying machine learning (ML) to medical imaging. It highlights several systemic issues, such as data biases, publication biases, and methodological shortcomings that impede progress. These issues include the reliance on datasets that do not fully reflect clinical environments, leading to biases and overfitting. Many studies focus on achieving high performance on benchmarks rather than addressing clinical needs, with evaluation processes often failing to capture practical significance.\n\nThe review outlines the misalignment between the abundance of research and real-world clinical impact. It criticizes the incentive structures that prioritize novel methods over clinically relevant improvements, and points out that many advancements in ML for medical imaging offer marginal gains overshadowed by evaluation noise.\n\nSeveral recommendations are made to improve the field. These include using larger, more diverse datasets, strengthening evaluation methods, and ensuring that model performance translates into clinical benefits. The article advocates for better documentation and transparency in publishing, suggesting that complex methods should not obscure reproducibility. Encouraging registered reports and focusing on patient outcomes rather than mere predictive accuracy are also recommended. Implementing these changes could help align ML research with clinical objectives, ultimately enhancing patient care."
